
game concept:
minesweeper + civilization + crash

short descripotion:
- minesweeper gameplay with an exploration mechanic.
- underlying references to failing capitalism?
- some CEO and their factory is spewing out mines to extort civilians
- the player's goal is to actually clean up mines, maybe save civilians?
- goal of the game is to reach the factory by navigating a sea littered with mines
